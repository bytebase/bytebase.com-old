## üèó Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Steps

1. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Run dev server.

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

This will fetch the SQL review configuration files before starting the nuxt service, you can check the script [fetch_config_files.sh](./scripts/fetch_config_files.sh) for details.

If you have any problems fetching these files, you could download them manually on the [Bytebase repository](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase).

The SQL review rules are based on the [rule configuration file](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/blob/main/frontend/src/types/sql-review-schema.yaml) from the Bytebase repository. We need to update that configuration if we want to update the rules.
