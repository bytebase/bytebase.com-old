It's a bit different from normal Markdown file. We need to save its status data into the `--- xxx ---` block. The mainly useful fields are those three:

- `title` is the document's tile in website;
- `position` indicates the display order. It consists of three two-digit numbers, present the level of `{{category}}/{{subcategory}}/{{document}}` structure. For example, this file's position is `40000`
