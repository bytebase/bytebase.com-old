# Backup and Restore Database

Bytebase supports both automatic and manual backup at the database level. User can also restore the backup to a different database.

User accesses the database backup feature by visiting the "Backups" tab from the database page.

Backups are stored inside the "backup" folder under the [--data](/docs/reference/command-line#data-less-than-less-than-directory-greater-than-greater-than) directory.
