# Archive

Bytebase disallows to delete the project/instance/environment resource permanently, this is both a precaution to prevent any unexpected data loss and also a feature to keep every action traceable.

Meanwhile, Bytebase offers an archiving feature. Archived resources won't appear in the normal interface and can only be found from the **Archive Dashboard.** Archived resources can still be restored any time.
