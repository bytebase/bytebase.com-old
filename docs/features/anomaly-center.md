# Anomaly Center

Bytebase periodically scans all managed instances and databases to catch potential anomalies such as [schema drift detection](drift-detection.md), [backup missing](backup-and-restore.md#detect-missing-backup). **Anomaly Center** is the place to provide user a holistic view to view those anomalies.
