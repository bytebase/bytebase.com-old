            maintain in confidence and protect the other party’s Confidential
            Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for
            its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a

            precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other
            party’s Confidential Information, including, without limitation,
            disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees,

            The foregoing obligations will not restrict either party from
            disclosing Confidential Information of the other party if required
            by any governmental body, so long as, to the extent allowed under
            applicable law, the party required to make the disclosure gives
            reasonable notice to the other party to enable it to contest the
            requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section will survive
            the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

          <h3 class="pt-4 text-xl text-gray-900 font-semibold">16.3 Waiver.</h3>

          <p>
            Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the
            Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            Any waiver of any provision of the Agreement will be effective only
            if in writing and signed by us.
          </p>

          <h3 class="pt-4 text-xl text-gray-900 font-semibold">16.4 Severability.</h3>

          <p>
            If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or
            for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or
            eliminated from the Agreement to the minimum extent necessary and
            will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
            provisions; except that in the event of unenforceability of the
            universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration
            agreement shall be unenforceable.
          </p>

            except in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or

          <p>
            Upon termination of the Agreement, any provision which, by its
            nature or express terms should survive, shall survive such
            termination or expiration.
