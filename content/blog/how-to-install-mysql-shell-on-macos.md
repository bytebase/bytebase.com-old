MySQL Shell is an interactive JavaScript, Python, or SQL interface for MySQL Server and is a component that you can install separately. It can be installed on your Mac by using Homebrew or the official MySQL Shell package.

## Homebrew

To install MySQL Shell using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you need to install Homebrew on your Mac first. If you aren’t sure if you have installed Homebrew already, open your terminal and run the following command to check.

```bash
brew -v
```

If you have, the terminal will display something like this:

Otherwise, run the following command to install Homebrew first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

On successful installation, your terminal will return a few new lines, with one of them stating:

```plain
==>Installation successful!
```

### Install MySQL Shell
