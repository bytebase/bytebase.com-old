You can install MySQL Shell on your Mac by using one of these two ways: with the help of Homebrew or to install using the MySQL Shell package.

## Homebrew

To install MySQL Shell using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you need to install Homebrew on your Mac first. If you aren‚Äôt sure if you have installed Homebrew already, open your terminal and run the following command to check.

```bash
brew -v
```

If you have, the terminal will display something like this:

Otherwise, run the following command to install Homebrew first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

On successful installation, your terminal will return a few new lines, with one of them stating:

```bash
==>Installation successful!
```

### Installing MySQL Shell

To [install MySQL Shell using Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/mysql-shell), run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
brew install --cask mysql-shell
```

The installation will start shortly. You will know it's successfully installed when your Terminal returns the following lines:

```bash
üç∫  mysql-shell was successfully installed!
```

## MySQL Shell package

The second way is to download the [MySQL Shell for the macOS package](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/).

Select the corresponding Operating System and OS Version of your Mac, and download the package.

When the installer finishes, it means you have successfully installed MySQL Shell for Mac, feel free to eject the DMG and delete the file.

## Starting MySQL Shell

Open a new Terminal window and start MySQL Shell using this command:

```bash
mysqlsh
```

This will start MySQL Shell in JavaScript mode (by default). To connect to a server, check out [MySQL Shell Connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-connections.html).
