## What is a Database Schema Change

A database schema is the structure of a database, which describes the relationships between the
different tables and fields in the database. A schema change refers to any alteration to this
structure, such as adding a new table, modifying the data type of a field, or changing the
relationships between tables.

Database schema changes are typically necessary when a database needs to be updated to support new
features or functionality, or to improve system performance or security. In some cases,
schema changes may also be required to fix bugs or other issues with the database.

Making a schema change can be a complex and risky process, as it can affect the entire database and
any applications or processes that rely on the database. Therefore, it's important to carefully plan
and execute schema changes to minimize the risk of errors or data loss.

## Common Database Schema Change Mistakes

1. **Failing to plan the change:** Before making any changes to the database schema, it's important to
   carefully plan the change and make sure it won't cause any problems or data loss. This includes
   identifying any potential conflicts with existing data or applications, and determining the best
   approach for making the change.

1. **Not testing the change:** It's a good idea to test the change in a development environment before
   applying it to the production database. This will allow you to see if the change works as
   expected and identify any potential issues before they affect your live systems.

1. **Not using a database migration tool:** Many database systems have tools that can help you manage
   schema changes. These tools can automate the process of applying the changes to the database,
   which can help reduce the risk of errors and make the process more efficient.

1. **Not communicating with your team:** It's important to keep your team informed about the changes
   you're making to the database schema. This will ensure that everyone is aware of the changes and
   can take the necessary steps to update any applications or processes that depend on the database.

1. **Not creating a backup:** Before making any changes to the database schema, it's essential to create
   a full backup of the database. This will allow you to restore the database to a previous state if
   something goes wrong.

## Best Practice to Make Schema Changes

There are two approaches to deploy the database schema change:

- **Coupled:** Deploy the schema change at the same time when deploying the application.
- **Decoupled:** Separate the schema change from the application deployment.

### Coupled Database Schema Change with Application Deployment

Almost every application begins with the coupled approach. And many application frameworks such as
Ruby on Rails, Django offer built-in migration facilities to do schema change, so are various ORMs.
The basic idea is you write a set of SQL statements to migrate the schema forward, and supply
another set of SQL statements to rollback the schema in case bad things happen. Those SQL statements
are bundled with the application release, and are executed right before the new code binary starts
the next time.

While coupled approach is straightforward, it does have several limitations:

1. Very little control when schema change goes wrong. Application would not start and it requires
   manual intervention.
1. Some schema changes may take a long time to finish, which means downtime when deploying the new
   version releases.
1. Not suitable for applications where there are multiple server instances accessing the same
   database. Since any of the server instance may perform the schema change, and it requires extra
   locking mechanism to coordinate the change.
1. Not suitable for team collaboration where there are dedicated DBAs or Platform Engineers to manage
   the databases. As for the coupled approach, the centralized DBAs or Platform Engieers don't know
   when the schema change happens. Instead, they will only be paged by the monitoring system that
   one of the instances is malfunctioning, and then spend a lot of effort to trace down it's
   caused by a reckless schema change made by an application team.

[Sourcegaph RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_wqvNbEGhMzu45CHZNrLQYys7gl0AtVpLluGp4cbQKk/edit#heading=h.ddeuyk4t99yx)
lists the typical issues with the coupled approach. And their solution is to decouple the schema
change from code deployments.

### Decoupled Database Schema Change from Application Deployment

The core idea of decoupled solution is to move schema change into a separate process. The typical
workflow is first performing the schema change needed for the new release. If schema
change goes wrong, the change will be rolled back immediately. After the schema change completes,
then the team will find a time later to deploy the new code release.

The main benefit is the team now has much better control over when and how to perform the schema
change. It separates the risky schema change from the code deployment during the new
release cycle. We all know change contributes to most outages, and it's a good practice to separate
different changes to limit the change scope and risk. You don't want to wait until the new
application deployment to learn that the new schema is problematic.

On the other hand, decoupled approach does come with more overhead:

1. The application code needs to be compatible with the current schema as well as the future schema.
   This is not a requirement for the coupled approach where the new release only starts if the
   schema change succeeds. Thus the application code can assume to always run against the latest
   schema.
1. An extra process to perform the schema change.

For 1, though it requires more work, it's always a good practice to write code in a backward
compatible way with the database schema.

For 2, database schema change is a risky operation, so it does demand a formal change review process.

## Summary

Coupled schema change is simple, it's suitable for self-contained application where database,
backend server and frontend are bundled and deployed together. Desktop and self-contained mobile
apps fall into this category. These apps are usaully small and don't perform heavy database
operations. On the other hand, many web apps are separated into different components, managed by
cross-functional teams and require careful database change coordination. In such case, decoupled
schema change is the only viable option.

In the next post, we will cover various tools to perform the coupled and decoupled database schema
change respectively.
