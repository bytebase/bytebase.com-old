description: The arrival of Generative AI completely overturns the existing interface interaction paradigm, bringing everyone back to the starting line. How to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime oppurtunity?

The first software I was involved in after graduation provided a complete set of components from database to GUI controls, and then to custom scripting language, allowing users to build an app purely by dragging and dropping. Today, it is known as the so-called no-code/low-code platform. The software I helped develop was created way back in 1985 and is still being worked on, now at version 19.

FileMaker Pro is less known as its successor, Airtable. But as a veteran software, it still has a large user base. OG e-commerce marketplace Groupon was made with FileMaker; Apple's visitor system at their headquarters also runs on FileMaker in Kiosk mode; most dental clinic information systems in the US are also built upon FileMaker.

A more appropriate name for FileMaker is probably App Maker (Google borrowed from FileMaker's idea to launch a product called App Maker, but [later shut it down](https://venturebeat.com/business/google-will-shut-down-app-maker-on-january-19-2021/)). At that time, there was another software born around the same time as FileMaker that also did something similar to App Maker. It was called [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard).

Although HyperCard is not well-known, its influence on the Internet today is far-reaching: the World Wide Web, Netscape Navigator, and JavaScript were all inspired by HyperCard. For example, the first letters of the words in the HTTP protocol are from HyperCard.

A few days ago, Sequoia Capital published "[Developer Tools 2.0](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/)", where Developer Tools 1.0 corresponds to GUI-based DevTools. And if DevTools are defined as software that helps build software (App Maker), then HyperCard was the developer tool that opened the 1.0 era.

HyperCard was born in 1987, that's 36 years ago. With the arrival of Generative AI, we are witnessing the first fundamental change in software interface interaction, from GUI-based to chat-based. In this revolution, production tools themselves, i.e., DevTools, are at the forefront of the revolution.

Database tools are also a subclass of DevTools. We contended whether to develop an independent SQL client, but against products that have been developed for 10+ years, we weren't able to find enough differentiation. The arrival of Generative AI completely overturns the existing interface interaction paradigm, bringing everyone back to the starting line, and making all those GUI components that have accumulated over so many years, all those dialog boxes, suddenly unnecessary. We wouldn't want to miss out on such a rare opportunity, and so we proudly introduce our solution to the Developer Tools 2.0 era - **SQL Chat** ([https://sqlchat.ai](https://sqlchat.ai)).

From the GUI era opened by HyperCard to the Internet era pioneered by Netscape, to today's Chat era led by OpenAI, ChatGPT, GitHub Colipot, and Notion AI, we see the Tools for Thought building that Alan Kay and others envisioned so many years ago coming to fruition.
