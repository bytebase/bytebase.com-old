title: Change Databases from Multiple Environments
---

A development pipeline usually consists of multiple environments such as dev, test, integration, staging, prod.
Each environment has its own isolated database to store the respective data. A schema change will
be propagated from each databases following the development pipeline.

In Bytebase, you can select multiple databases from the different environments to apply the database change.

Then Bytebase will then create an issue to track the multi-database changes.
