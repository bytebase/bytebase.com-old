title: SQL Advisor GitHub App

Bytebase also provides the [GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/bytebase) to let users integrate the SQL review into their GitHub PR workflow.

The App allows you to create the SQL review policy for your repositories and trigger the SQL check in the pull request.

Repository configuration:

- **Database dialect**: for now, we support

  - **MySQL** dialect, vanilla MySQL, and other database engines adopting its dialect such as TiDB.
  - **PostgreSQL** dialect, vanilla PostgreSQL, and other database engines adopting its dialect such as CockroachDB.

- **SQL file path**: the file path for the SQL files in the regex format. Only matched files will be checked in the pull request. We
  will subscribe all SQL files in the repository by default.

### Step 3 - Preview

Preview and confirm the SQL review policy.

## SQL check in the pull request

If you create a pull request containing SQL file change, it will trigger the SQL check according to the SQL review policy.

The SQL review will run the check and comment on the pull request.
