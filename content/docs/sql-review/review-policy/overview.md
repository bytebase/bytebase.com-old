title: Review Policy
---

Bytebase defines SQL Review Policy for each [environment](/docs/concepts/data-model#environment).
The SQL Review Policy is essentially a set of SQL lint rules defined in [SQL Review Rule](/docs/sql-review/review-rules). Once configured, Bytebase will check SQL against the configured those rules.
