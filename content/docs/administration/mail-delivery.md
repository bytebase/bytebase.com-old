- SMTP Server Host: The host of your SMTP Server.
- SMTP Server Port: The port of your SMTP Server. It is usually one of 22, 465 and 587.
- From: The sender address of all Bytebase mails.
- Authentication Method: Bytebase supports NONE, PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5 and PLAIN is the most common.
- SMTP Username/SMTP Password: They are available if the authentication method is PLAIN/LOGIN/CRAM-MD5.
- Encryption: Bytebase supports NONE, SSL/TLS and STARTTLS. This can usually be determined by port. Port 22 generally uses NONE, port 465 generally uses SSL/TLS, and port 587 generally uses STARTTLS.
