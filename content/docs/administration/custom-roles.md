<hint-block type="info">

This feature is only available in the Enterprise Plan.

</hint-block>

In **Settings > Custom Roles**, you can define new custom roles and apply them to project members.

The custom roles include very limited permissions in projects. They are basically just "viewer" roles.


The custom roles can be used in [custom approval](/docs/administration/custom-approval).

## Create and manage custom roles

To create custom roles, go to **Settings > Custom Roles**. Click **Add role** to create a new role.

You can then grant users the roles in the project setting tab.
