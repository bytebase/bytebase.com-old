[Tenant databases](/docs/concepts/tenant-database) are managed through tenant projects in Bytebase.

Tenant projects empowers you to:

1. Roll out schema changes and data updates to mutiple tenant databases by their environments, tenant labels or geolocations, or any combination of them.
1. Progressively roll out through different stages, and only proceed to the next stage when all of rollouts in the current stage are successful.
