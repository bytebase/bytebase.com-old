![Spanner database detail page](/static/docs/how-to/spanner/database.webp)

From the Spanner database detail page, you can get the project ID and the instance ID from the URL.

For example, the project ID and instance ID are `spanner-test-3717002` and `spanner-bb1` respectively for the above database.

When [adding an instance](/docs/get-started/configure-workspace/add-an-instance/#add-an-instance) in Bytebase, the `Project ID and instance ID` input should be `projects/spanner-test-3717002/instances/spanner-bb1`.
