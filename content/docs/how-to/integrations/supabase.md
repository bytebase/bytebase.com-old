description: Tutorial on how to manage Supabase PostgreSQL database
---

## Overview

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open source Firebase alternative providing all the backend features you need to build a product. You can use it completely, or just the features you need.

As Supabase provides full [PostgreSQL database instances](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database), teams can use Bytebase to manage the database development lifecycle for the Supabase databases.

While Supabase already has an easy-to-use GUI to conduct database operations, Bytebase adds the extra value to offer a systematic database development and change workflow. This is especially useful for cross-functional teams requiring collaboration (e.g. having dedicated DBA or platform engineering team apart from the application development teams).

## Prerequisites

- You need a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (free signup).
- After signup, create a supabase project, you can start with the Free plan which already includes a full PostgreSQL instance.

## The Procedure

### Step 1 - Visit Supabase project's database setting

![supabase-database-setting](/docs/how-to/integrations/supabase-database-setting.webp)

Note down the `Host` and `Port` info. For `User` and `Password`, we recommend creating a dedicated user for Bytebase instead of using the default postgres user.

### Step 2 - Create a database user for Bytebase

Visit Supabase SQL Editor and create a database user and grants it SUPERUSER role. Below example creates a user named "bytebase".

<hint-block type="info">

If you stick with the default postgres user provided by Supabase, you will need to execute "ALTER ROLE postgres SUPERUSER" from the SQL Editor as well. See [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/1856#issuecomment-1165894044).

### Step 3 - Add the Supabase database instance to Bytebase

Copy the `Host`, `Port`, `User` and `Password` from the last two steps to the form and click "Create". See [Add an Instance](/docs/get-started/configure-workspace/add-an-instance) for more details.

### Step 4 - Check the database instance is properly imported

All databases should be sycned properly. Expect some delay if the database instance is large.

So are the tables under the databases.
