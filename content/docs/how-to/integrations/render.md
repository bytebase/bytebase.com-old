description: Tutorial on how to manage Render PostgreSQL database
---

## Overview

[Render](https://render.com/) is a hosting service that allows you to deploy almost anything to the cloud, including static sites, web apps, Dockerfiles, APIs. And that includes [PostgreSQL databases](https://render.com/docs/databases).

You can create PostgreSQL databases on Render and use Bytebase to manage the database development lifecycle for those databases.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up](https://dashboard.render.com/) for a Render account.
- After signing up, [create](https://dashboard.render.com/new/database) a PostgreSQL database. Feel free to choose the [Free Plan](https://render.com/docs/free), but note that free databases will expire in 90 days and Render will delete them if not upgraded.

## The Procedure

### Step 1 - Add Render database instance to Bytebase

Go to your Render dashboard and click on the database you created. We will need the connection details from this page.

From your Bytebase **Create Instance** page, choose **Add Instance**, fill in the details to create the connection as follows:

- Database: `PostgreSQL`.
- Instance Name: any name of your choosing, e.g. `render-db`.
- Environment: `Prod` or `Test` (select the environment you want to add the instance to).
- Host or Socket: from your Render database page, copy the **External Database URL** to your text editor. The URL will look like `postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`. Copy the `<host>:<port>` part to the Host or Socket field.
- Port: 5432 (Render uses the default PostgreSQL port of 5432 to connect)
- Username: copy the **Username** from your Render database page.
- Password: copy the **Password** from your Render database page.
- Database: copy the **Database** name from your Render database page.

See [Add an Instance](/docs/get-started/configure-workspace/add-an-instance) for more details.

### Step 2 - Check if the database instance is properly imported

All databases should be sycned properly. Expect some delay if the database instance is large.

So should the tables under the databases.
