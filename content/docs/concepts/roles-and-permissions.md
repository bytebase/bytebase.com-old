title: Roles and Permissions (RBAC)
---
## Overview

Bytebase employs RBAC (Role-Based-Access-Control) and provides two role sets at the workspace and project level:

- Workspace roles: `Owner`, `DBA`, `Developer`
- Project roles: `Owner`, `Developer`

The workspace role maps to the role in an engineering organization, while the project level role maps to the role in a specific team or project. Every user is assigned a workspace role, and if a particular user is involved in a particular project, then she will also be assigned a project role accordingly.

![org-role-mapping](/static/docs/rbac/org-role-mapping.webp)

Above diagram describes the mapping between an engineering org and the corresponding roles in the Bytebase workspace. Note, a particular user can be assigned multiple roles as well:

- A user can only be assigned one of the workspace roles.
- In a particular project, a user can be assigned one of the project roles, while a user can be assigned different project roles in the different projects.

Real-world scenarios:

- Engineering orgs may not establish a dedicated DBA or platform engineering group. In such case, usaually the application engineering group head and the tech leads will wear those hats. Say a user named Alice can be a `Workspace DBA` and a `Project Owner` for Project Apollo at the same time.

- An application developer could be involved in multiple projects. In such case, that engineer would also be assigned project roles in different projects respectively. Say a user named Bob can be a `Workspace Developer`, a `Project Owner` for Project Apollo and a `Project Developer` for Project Mars at the same time.

## Workspace roles

By default, the first registered user is granted the `Owner` role, all following registered users are granted `Developer` role. `Owner` can update any user's role later.

## Project roles

Any user can create project. By default, the project creator is granted the `Project Owner` role.

<hint-block type="info">

`Project Developer` grants a project membership and does not grant any additional project level permissions. If the user is a project member, that project and the project's databases will be listed on the user's left sidebar.

</hint-block>

<hint-block type="info">

`Workspace DBA` and `Workspace Owner` assume the `Project Owner` role for all projects.

</hint-block>

## Database permissions

Bytebase does not define database specific roles. Whether a user can perform certain action to the database is based on the user's Workspace role and the role of the project owning the database.

| Database Permission |     Project Developer     | Project Owner | Workspace DBA | Workspace Owner |
| ------------------: | :-----------------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: |
|  Take manual backup |            ✔️             |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |
|       Enable backup |                           |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |
| Edit database label |                           |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |
|   Transfer database | Not allowed in Enterprise |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |

## Sheet permissions

User can save sheets from [SQL Editor](/docs/sql-editor/overview). A sheet always belongs to a project. Sheet has three visibility levels:

- Private
- Project
- Public
