Tenant databases are the homogeneous databases with identical schema in a tenant project. Each individual database corresponds to the combination of a tenant, location, and deployment environment.

Bytebase offers streamlined experience for tenant databases through [Tenant Database Management](/docs/tenant-database-management/overview).

Below is an example showing how a schema change rollout to all tenant databases from **Dev** environment all the way to the **Prod** look like in Bytebase.
