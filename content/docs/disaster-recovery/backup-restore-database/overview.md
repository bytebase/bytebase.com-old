title: Backup and Restore Database
---

Bytebase supports both automatic and manual backup at the database level. User can also restore the backup to a different database.

When Bytebase restores the backup to a new database, it also records the original parent database as well as a branch migration history linking with the restoring process.

User accesses the database backup feature by visiting the "Backups" tab from the database page.

At the workspace level, Bytebase also supports enforcing [backup schedule policy](/docs/administration/environment-policy/backup-schedule-policy) for each environment. e.g. DBA can require the database in `production` environment to have `daily` backups.

## Local Storage

By default, backups are stored inside the "backup" folder under the [--data](/docs/reference/command-line#--data-directory) directory locally.
