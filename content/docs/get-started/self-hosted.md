title: Self-Hosted Bytebase
---

This section guides you to run self-hosted version of Bytebase.

You'll use `Bytebase Test Suite` to [get familiar with the product in 5 mins](/docs/get-started/quick-start).

Then there're several options to [install Bytebase](/docs/get-started/install/overview), including how to [run a MySQL instance locally with Docker](/docs/get-started/install/local-mysql-instance) and how to add it as an Instance for testing purpose.
