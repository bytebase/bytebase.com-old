title: Work with a Project
---

After you configured the workspace, it's time to work with a **Project**.

**Project** is the container to group logically related **Databases**, **Issues** and **Users** together. In Bytebase, A **Database** or an **Issue** always belongs to a single **Project**.

Project is similar to the project concept in other dev tools such as Jira, GitLab. Project is also the peering entity with the VCS repository to set up GitOps workflow.

There are two roles at the project level: **Owner** and **Developer**.

To make changes to databases, you have to [create a project](create-a-project) first, and then [run a SQL workflow](run-a-ui-workflow).
