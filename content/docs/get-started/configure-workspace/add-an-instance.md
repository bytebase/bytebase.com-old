title: Add an Instance
---

**Database Instance** or simply **Instance** models after a single database instance which is usually accessed via a host:port address. A typical database instance could be your on-premises MySQL instance, an AWS RDS instance etc. Each **Database Instance** belongs to an **Environment**.

Currently Bytebase supports **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **TiDB**, **Snowflake**, **ClickHouse**, **MongoDB** and **Spanner** instances.

This document describes how to add an instance in order to synchronize databases.

## Prerequisites

- **Workspace Owner** or **Workspace DBA** role
- If you don't have an existing instance on hand, you can [add a local MySQL instance](/docs/get-started/install/local-mysql-instance).

## Add an instance

1. Click **Instances** on the top bar.
1. Click **Add Instance**.
1. Select an **Instance Type** on the top.
1. Enter **Instance name**, select **Environment**, enter **Host or Socket** and **Port**.
1. Enter connection info: **Username** and **Password**, and click **Test Connection**.
1. (Optional) Enter SSL connection info:
   1. Choose **None** to not use SSL connection.
   1. Choose **CA Certificate** to use SSL connection with CA certificate only.
   1. Choose **CA Certificate + Client Key + Client Certificate** to use a full SSL connection.

1. Environment cannot be changed once the instance has been created.
1. The screenshot assumes you run Bytebase inside Docker and try to connect to a database instance on the same host. Thus it uses `host.docker.internal`. If Bytebase is not running inside Docker, you should supply the normal `127.0.0.1` to connect the instance on the same host [(detailed explanation)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24326540/235983).
1. The SSL connection configuration only supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, TiDB and ClickHouse for now. You can also configure the SSL connection on the instance details page.
1. On how to connect to Spanner databases, see [How to Find Project ID and Instance ID](/docs/how-to/spanner/how-to-find-project-id-and-instance-id) and [How to Create a Service Account for Bytebase](/docs/how-to/spanner/how-to-create-a-service-account-for-bytebase)

After adding an instance, click **Databases** on the navigation bar. You can find the table is still empty. It’s because you haven’t created any project yet. In Bytebase, only databases belong to a user project will show up on the Databases page.

## Configure read-only connection

To separate from admin connection, you can configure a read-only connection used by SQL Editor once an instance is added. This separation can be configured at the database user/role access control level or replication instance level.

1. Create a new role with read-only access or a read-replica instance.
1. Click **Create** on **Connection info**.
1. Enter read-only connection info. If this is a read-replica instance, you need to enter its host and port information.
1. Click **Update** to finish the configuration.
