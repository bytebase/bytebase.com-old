title: Configure the Workspace
---

Now that you have successfully deployed Bytebase. Before making any changes to databases, you should first configure the workspace.

A single Bytebase deployment represents a single **Workspace**. At the workspace level, you can configure global settings applicable to all projects within this workspace. There are three roles at the workspace level: **Owner**, **DBA**, and **Developer**.

This section guides you through the workspace level configuration before you start any **Project**.

At workspace level, you can

- [Register accounts](register-accounts) or [Add Owners, DBAs and Developers](manage-members) to the workspace.
- [Set up environments](set-up-environments) (e.g. Test, Prod) to fit your working process.
- [Add instances](add-an-instance) to make it possible to synchronize databases - if you don't have an existing instance on hand, you can [add a local MySQL instance](/docs/get-started/install/local-mysql-instance).
- [Customize the Logo](customize-the-logo).
