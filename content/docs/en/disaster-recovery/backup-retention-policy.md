title: Backup Retention Policy
---

If you have enabled automatic backup for a database, Bytebase will automatically backup the database at the configured schedule. If you have not enabled the [cloud backup feature](/docs/disaster-recovery/backup-restore-database/cloud-backup), the local disk will be gradually filled up. Retention policy can solve this problem by regularly deleting the unused old backups.

## Configuration

### Step 1 - Enable automatic backup

If you have not enabled automatic backup for the database, click the "Enable backup" button. Otherwise, click the "Edit" button.

### Step 2 - Set retention period

Set the days you want to preserve the backup. Bytebase will automatically delete the expired backups after the configured retention period.

Now you have successfully configured the backup retention policy.
