title: Drift Detection
---

Bytebase is supposed to take over applying the database schema changes on behalf of the user. It records the detailed migration history and the before/after schema snapshot for each migration it applies.

A background process periodically compares the recorded latest schema with the actual schema in the targeting database and surface the drift if found. Drift usually happens when user applies out-of-band schema changes (such as hot fix) directly to the database without using Bytebase.
