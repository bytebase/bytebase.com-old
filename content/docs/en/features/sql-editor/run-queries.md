title: Run and EXPLAIN Query
---

<hint-block type="info">

Please note that SQL Editor only supports running SELECT queries now. SQL will detect your SQL queries. If you are running DDL or DML change queries, it will prompt you to create a new issue to start the SQL review process.

</hint-block>

## Run query

Click the `Run` button or use the shortcut key `(⌘ + Enter)` to run your queries in the SQL Editor.

If you have multiple SQL queries separated by semicolons, SQL Editor will only run the first query for now.

## Explain query

SQL Editor provides an `Explain` button to run EXPLAIN on the selected query. You can click it or use the shortcut key `(⌘ + E)` instead of prepending EXPLAIN manually.
