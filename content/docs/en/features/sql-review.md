title: SQL Review
---

SQL Review is the classic and widely used process for developers and DBAs to coordinate database schema changes.

Developers first submit their SQL statement for DBA to review. After review is approved, the SQL statement will then be applied to the corresponding database. For a single change, this step would normally be repeated for each environment (e.g. integration, staging, prod).

To facilitate this heavily used process, Bytebase has designed a comprehensive interface to unify the stage progression and the collaboration experience into a single page.

1. Status banner highlighting the issue status.

2. Issue abstract. If the issue is created by a code commit from a linked repository, that code commit information will be displayed.
