title: Anomaly Center
---

Bytebase periodically scans all managed instances and databases to catch potential anomalies such as [schema drift detection](/docs/features/drift-detection), [backup missing](/docs/features/backup-and-restore#detect-missing-backup). **Anomaly Center** is the place to provide user a holistic view to view those anomalies.
