title: Disallow Leading % in LIKE
---

Database cannot use an index to match entries when there is a leading wildcard. It can cause serious performance problems because it may scan the entire table.

## How the rule works

Bytebase considers this rule to be violated if the SQL has leading wildcard LIKE.
