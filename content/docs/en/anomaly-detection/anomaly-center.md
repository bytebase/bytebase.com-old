title: Anomaly Center
---

Bytebase periodically scans all managed instances and databases to catch potential anomalies such as [schema drift detection](/docs/anomaly-detection/drift-detection), [backup missing](/docs/disaster-recovery/backup-restore-database/overview). **Anomaly Center** is the place to provide user a holistic view to view those anomalies.
