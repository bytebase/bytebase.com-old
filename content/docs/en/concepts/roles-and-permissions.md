title: Roles and Permissions
---

Bytebase has two disjoint set of roles:

1. Workspace roles: `Owner`, `DBA`, `Developer`
2. Project roles: `Owner`, `Developer`

## Workspace roles

By default, the first registered user is granted the `Owner` role, all following registered users are granted `Developer` role. `Owner` can update any user's role later.

## Project roles

Any user can create project. By default, the project creator is granted the `Project Owner` role.

<hint-block type="info">

`Project Developer` grants a project membership and does not grant any additional project level permissions. If the user is a project member, that project and the project's databases will be listed on the user's left sidebar.

</hint-block>

<hint-block type="info">

`Workspace DBA` and `Workspace Owner` assume the `Project Owner` role for all projects.

|                    Project Permission | Project Developer | Project Owner | Workspace DBA | Workspace Owner |
| ------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: |
|                   Change project role |                   |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |

## Database permissions

Bytebase does not define database specific roles. Whether a user can perform certain action to the database is based on the user's Workspace role and the role of the project owning the database.

| Database Permission | Project Developer | Project Owner | Workspace DBA | Workspace Owner |
| ------------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: |
|  Take manual backup |        ✔️         |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |
|       Enable backup |                   |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |
|   Transfer database |                   |      ✔️       |      ✔️       |       ✔️        |

## Sheet permissions

User can save sheets from [SQL Editor](/docs/sql-editor/overview). A sheet always belongs to a project. Sheet has three visibility levels:

- Private
- Project
- Public
