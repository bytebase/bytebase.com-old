title: Deploy to Production
---

You have tried Bytebase via [quick start](../quick-start), now it's time to deploy it to production.

First, check [System Requirement and Support](/docs/faq#system-requirements-and-supported-versions).

There are three different ways to deploy Bytebase to production:

1. [Docker](deploy-with-docker)
2. [Installation Script](installation-script)
3. [Build from Source Code](build-from-source-code)

By default, Bytebase bundles an embedded PostgreSQL instance for storing its own metadata. Howeverï¼Œyou can choose to store the metadata in [an external PostgreSQL database](/docs/get-started/install/external-postgres).
