title: Register Accounts

After deploying Bytebase successfully, you need to register accounts for your team members.

## Register an admin account

The first registered account after deployment will be granted a **Workspace Owner** role.

## **Register a regular account**

After the admin account is created, you can register a regular account and will be granted **Workspace Developer** role.

2. In GitLab, set the public email the same as the registered email in Bytebase.

2. Click **Members** on the left side bar, and you can see the members page.
3. Click the name of any member, and you will be redirected to that memberâ€™s detail page.
