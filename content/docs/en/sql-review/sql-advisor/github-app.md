title: SQL Advisor GitHub App

Bytebase also provides the [GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/bytebase) to let users integrate the SQL review into their GitHub CI.

The App allows you to create the SQL review policy for your repositories, and trigger the SQL check in the pull request.

The GitHub App is free to use, you don't need any subscription plan.
