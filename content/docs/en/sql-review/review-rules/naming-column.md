title: Column Naming Convention
---

The unified naming convention is desired by developers. And the same applies to the database space. Bytebase provides this rule to unify the column naming convention.

## About convention format

`Column Naming Convention` uses [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) format for naming pattern, and also limits the naming max length. The default maximum length is 64 characters.

### Some typical format

| Name             | Regular Expression       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| snake_lower_case | `^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$`     |
| CamelCase        | `^([A-Z][a-z]*)+$`       |
| lowerCamelCase   | `^[a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]*)*$` |
| kebab-case       | `^[a-z]+(-[a-z]+)*$`     |

## How the rule works

Bytebase checks that all column names in DDL conform to the naming conventions.

Specifically, Bytebase checks:

- `CREATE TABLE` statements
- `ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN` statements
- `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS` statements
- `ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN` statements

## Support database engine
