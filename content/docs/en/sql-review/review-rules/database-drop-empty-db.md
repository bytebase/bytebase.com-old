title: Drop database restriction
---

Can only drop the database if there's no table in it.
It requires users to drop all containing tables first before dropping the database.

## How the rule works

Bytebase checks if there exists any table in the specific database.

Specifically, Bytebase checks:

- `DROP DATABASE` statements

## Support database engine

- MySQL
- TiDB

Support for PostgreSQL is coming soon.
