## Project webhook
User can configure project-level webhooks to let Bytebase post messages to the configured webhook endpoint upon various events.

For example, **[Slack](https://slack.com/)**.

Read [Project Webhook](/docs/administration/webhook-integration/project-webhook) in detail.

## Database webhook
User can configure database-level webhooks to let Bytebase post the configured webhook endpoint upon a successful backup.

For example, **[Better Uptime Heartbeats](https://docs.betteruptime.com/monitoring/monitor-types/cron-and-heartbeat-monitor)**.
