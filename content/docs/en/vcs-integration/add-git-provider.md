title: Add Git Provider
---

Estimate setup time: 30 minutes.
This guide will show you how to integrate a version control system (VCS) with Bytebase. This is a [reference setup](https://demo.bytebase.com/setting/version-control/bytebasegitlabcom-16001) showing what it will look like after the setup.

For now, Bytebase supports:

1. [Self-host GitLab EE/CE](/docs/vcs-integration/self-host-gitlab)
2. [GitHub.com](/docs/vcs-integration/github-com)

And we have plans to support more Git providers, including: GitHub Enterprise and GitLab.com.
