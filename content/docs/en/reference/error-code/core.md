## Migration

<h3 id="201">201 - Missing migration schema</h3>

Bytebase can't find the migration schema in the instance. When user successfully adds an instance to Bytebase, Bytebase will try to create a database called "bytebase" in the target instance. This database is the migration schema Bytebase relies on to store the migration history. Without this schema, any schema migration attempt will fail to proceed.

<h3 id="204">204 - Migration missing baseline</h3>
