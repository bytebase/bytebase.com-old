title: Backup and Restore Database
---

Bytebase supports both automatic and manual backup at the database level. User can also restore the backup to a different database.

User accesses the database backup feature by visiting the "Backups" tab from the database page.

Backups are stored inside the "backup" folder under the [--data](/docs/reference/command-line#--data-directory) directory.
