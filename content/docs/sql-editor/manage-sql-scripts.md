title: Manage SQL Scripts with Sheet
---

`Sheet` is the medium for you to interact inside SQL Editor. Sheet is the entity where you store,
run and share the SQL scripts with your teammates.

## Save sheet

Click **Save** on the upper right of the Editor or use the shortcut key `(âŒ˜ + S)` to save
your SQL queries for later reference. SQL Editor will also automatically record SQL queries which
have run successfully. You can find them in the History panel on the left.
