## 📰 Fresh off the press

- Database change has long been the most critical step in a release. If you do it well, you are one step closer to [improving CI/CD efficiency](/blog/database-cicd-best-practice).
- With Bytebase, a team can have a formalized review and rollout process to [make Snowflake schema change and data change](/blog/database-change-management-with-snowflake).
- This tutorial will bring your [Snowflake schema change to the next level by introducing the GitOps workflow](/blog/database-change-management-with-snowflake-and-github), where you commit the schema change script to the GitHub repository, which will in turn trigger the schema deployment pipeline in Bytebase.

## 📕 Installation and Upgrade

Follow [Installation](/docs/get-started/install/overview). If you are upgrading from a previous version, restart after obtaining the newest release binary.
