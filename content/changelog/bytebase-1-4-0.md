## 📕 Installation and Upgrade

- For a fresh installation, follow [https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase#installation](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase#installation).
- For upgrading, we removed the `--host` flag, you need to remove it from the startup flag, and replace it with `--external-url` in this version. And if your port is not `80` or `443`, the `--external-url` needs to include the port number as well. Please check [Configure External URL](https://www.bytebase.com/docs/get-started/install/external-url) for details.
