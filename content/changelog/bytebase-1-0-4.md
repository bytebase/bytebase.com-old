## üöÄ ¬†Features

### bb CLI Support --dsn option in CLI

Support data source name (DSN) formats to connect databases in CLI, e.g. `--dsn mysql://user:passwd@host:port/dbname?opt1=val1&opt2=val2`

### Add installation script of bb CLI

User can install `bb` CLI with only one command `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytebase/bytebase/HEAD/scripts/install_bb.sh)"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytebase/bytebase/HEAD/scripts/install_bb.sh)&quot;)` . Previously, users needed to go through several steps from downloading on GitHub Release, decompressing and manually moving the files to executable file directory.

### Add dashboard page to manage all SQL sheets

Introducing the SQL sheet dashboard page as users can view all related sheets in a table view.

### Admin page to view all projects

Users whose roles are Owner and DBA in Workspace can view all projects under `Settings`.

### Added /healthz health check endpoint

This enables serverless platforms like [render.com](render.com) to point its health check endpoint to /healthy.

## üéÑ Enhancement

### Expose `Visit Default Project` button explicitly

The `Default Project` is the special project holding the databases synced from the database instance. Users usually need to visit this project to transfer the database to their own projects.
