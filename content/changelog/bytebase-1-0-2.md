- Open source an Employee sample database for MySQL [https://github.com/bytebase/employee-sample-database-mysql](https://github.com/bytebase/employee-sample-database-mysql) Â based on [https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db). The sample database will apply to daily tests, data presentation and document tutorials. We prepare 2 datasets:

  - Full dataset (~170 MB) including 300024 employee records.
  - Small dataset (~6 MB) including 10000 employee records.

- We're working to support online schema change for MySQL using gh-ost. You can check the design doc at [https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/blob/main/docs/design/gh-ost-integration.md](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/blob/main/docs/design/gh-ost-integration.md) and give feedback if you are a DBA or a gh-ost user.
