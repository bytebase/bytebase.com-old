## üåÑ Sunset

**Retire issue rollback feature**
Previously, Bytebase allows user to specify a rollback SQL for the rollback. And if user chooses to rollback the SQL, Bytebase will use the rollback SQL to create that rollback SQL. This only sounds good in theory, because in reality, it's already a big hurdle to write a good schema change SQL, it would be even challenging to ask the developer to provide a correct rollback SQL at the same time.

Thus, we decide to retire this feature. Meanwhile we already have ideas for a much better solution without requiring developer to write the rollback SQL manually. Please stay tuned.
